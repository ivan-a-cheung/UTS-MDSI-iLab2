To the riser body may, for example, be welded a ring gear to form a unitary assembly, the ring gear having an axis of revolution aligned with the longitudinal axis. A continuous coating may, for example, be applied to at least a selected portion of a surface of the unitary assembly. Various embodiments may advantageously provide a cost-efficient, weight-efficient, and/or time-efficient unitary body which may, for example, be coupled to machinery to provide a shaftless torque-transmitter.'}],\n",

Under a shifting operation state in a test mode, the control circuit controls the multiplexer to select an operation input terminal to receive and output an isolation control signal having the enabling state to the control input terminal. Under a capturing operation state in the test mode, the control circuit controls the multiplexer to select a test input terminal to receive and output the test signal to the control input terminal. The control circuit further determines whether the isolation circuit performs signal transmission or signal isolation according to the signals at the data input terminal and the data output terminal.',\n",

Changes in appearance of the user due to age, health, facial hair, hair color, hair length and many other evolutionary changes are automatically captured and contribute to the learning set. Accordingly, the system itself gets smarter and faster with every subsequent authentication. In one non-limiting embodiment, a target of the most recent 500 captures are retained, and tuning may suggest a greater number of captures should or could be used. Preferably, with each new capture the oldest capture in the ongoing digital collection is automatically deleted by the system.',\n",

The engineered antibodies would confer modified receptor binding specificity to an IL-2-anti-IL2 antibody complex, inhibiting the binding of IL-2 to CD25. The engineered anti-IL-2 antibodies would facilitate expansion of subsets of effector immune cells and decrease undesirable effects caused by IL-2. Thus, the engineered anti-IL-2 antibodies would be useful in treating disease such as cancer and infection.',\n",

By determining the intent and desires of the user, tasks and queries associated with or requested by the user can be more effectively optimized, automated, or otherwise improved. In some computing environments, multiple users access a database which includes a collection of software objects. The objects within the database can sometimes form a hierarchy, with a parent-child relationship among them. Traditionally, a developer creating the database and the objects within can only determine a user's intent based on the actions taken by the user within the database. The present solution provides the developer with a higher level model representing different users' intents based on observed data from a number of sources in addition to the user's interaction with the database.\",\n",

Fading data, location data, or battery data is received from one or more user devices. Based on the received data, a determination is made using the data received (e.g., determining the battery data of the user device is below a threshold or determining the location of the user device). In response, the assignment of the user device to an uplink MIMO layer of available MIMO layers is restricted. The restricted uplink MIMO layer is a higher MIMO layer than another MIMO layer of the available MIMO layers. In response to restricting the assignment, the user device may be assigned to an available MIMO layer that is a lower MIMO layer than the restricted MIMO layer.',\n",

The UE may receive a data transmission over the first sidelink data channel and may determine to transmit feedback associated with the data transmission. The UE, based on the configuration of the set of feedback channel occasions, may perform LBT for each of the set of feedback channel occasions to determine which of the set of feedback channel occasions are available to the UE for transmitting the feedback associated with the data transmission. The UE may transmit feedback over one or more of the set of feedback channel occasions accordingly.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A method and prosthesis is provided for percutaneous repair of an anatomical defect, such as an inguinal hernia. The method involves percutaneously accessing the inguinal canal of a patient. Following hernia reduction, if required, the hernia defect may be accessed and repaired percutaneously from within the inguinal canal. An implantable prosthesis may be percutaneously delivered into the inguinal canal. The prosthesis may be advanced along the inguinal canal from the percutaneous entry location to the defect site, where it may be deployed over and/or within the defect. A biocompatible foam material may be percutaneously delivered into the inguinal canal to reduce and/or repair the hernia defect. The foam may fill and solidify in the canal to prevent abdominal viscera from reentering the canal. Ablative therapy may be performed within the inguinal canal to cause a fibrotic response resulting in scar tissue formation and/or tissue shrinkage that narrows the canal.',\n",

When the car door is in a closed position, a door opening sequence may commence causing the slidable base to move relative to the car door, but the car door will only open if the slidable base presses against an object, such as a roller on a hoistway door, in which case the locking arm of the interlock assembly moves from the locked to the unlocked position.',\n",

A method of operating a fuel injection system includes an engine controller determining if the system's injectors are operating in a multi-pulse mode for injecting multiple fuel pulses per combustion cycle to an engine's cylinders and, if so, monitoring pulse signals transmitted to the injectors for injecting the multiple fuel pulses. For each combustion cycle for each injector, the controller flags a cylinder misfire if any one of the fuel pulses for that combustion cycle is missed. For each cylinder, the controller calculates a misfire ratio of a total number of cylinder misfires to a total number of combustion cycles; if one of these misfire ratios exceeds a calibrated misfire limit, the controller commands a resident subsystem to execute control operations to mitigate the misfires.\",\n",

The injectable in situ pore-forming hydrogel system uses an injectable hydrogel as a continuous base phase, and isolated live cells and magnesium particles are distributed in the continuous base phase, where the injectable hydrogel is a precursor or prepolymer of hydrogel, which can form hydrogel by cross-linking. The injectable in situ pore-forming hydrogel system can be used to create pores while the gel encapsulates live cells, which makes use of both the injectability and porous structures of hydrogel, which is important for the repair of cavitary, surgically difficult and irregularly defective tissues; meanwhile, magnesium particles generate magnesium ions after the former undergoes gas production and degradation, which can improve the bioactivity of the gel and aid in tissue repair.',\n",

In various aspects, a cache memory randomly selects a cache line for eviction and/or replacement. The cache memory may also support multi-occupancy whereby the cache memory enters data reused from another cache line to replace the data of the randomly evicted cache line. By so doing, the cache memory may operate in a nondeterministic fashion, which may increase a probability of data remaining in the cache memory for subsequent requests.',\n",

The SSE compositions may further contain phosphorous, silicon, or a dopant atom, such as a halogen. These compositions are advantageous as they use Earth-abundant elements, have high voltage stability, excellent battery cycle performance, and are fabricated and used under conditions that do not require excessive external pressures which would otherwise limit their use in a production battery. In particular, the SSEs have a controllable microstructure, e.g., core-shell structure, that enhances their inherent stability while obviating the need for excessively large pressures to control the electrolyte stability. Methods of producing the compositions and rechargeable batteries including the composition are also provided.',\n",

Many embodiments provide a swallowable device for delivering the agents. Particular embodiments provide a swallowable device such as a capsule for delivering drugs into the intestinal wall or other GI lumen. Embodiments also provide various drug preparations that are configured to be contained within the capsule, advanced from the capsule into the intestinal wall and degrade to release the drug into the bloodstream to produce a therapeutic effect. The preparation can be operably coupled to delivery means having a first configuration where the preparation is contained in the capsule and a second configuration where the preparation is advanced out of the capsule into the intestinal wall. Embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for the delivery of drugs which are poorly absorbed, tolerated and/or degraded within the GI tract.',\n",

A master Long-Term Evolution (LTE) base station may operate in conjunction with a secondary New Radio (NR) base station to provide dual connectivity to user equipment (UE) operating in an environment. The LTE base station can steer traffic between the LTE base station and the NR base station based at least in part on policy information received at the LTE base station. The policy information can indicate, for a particular UE and for a particular Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI), whether the LTE base station can transfer a communication to the NR base station. Thus, traffic steering determinations can be based on the policy information, quality identifiers, device capability, signal strength(s), load level(s), and the like, thereby providing a flexible framework for steering wireless traffic in a dual connectivity environment.',\n",

Consistent cross-section built hull can have flat, round or pointed bottoms. Straight line hull from bow to stem under draught line brings outboard wave can pass over in a straight line along hull without any affects from vessel hull because of no horizontal curvature exist on hull from bow to stem under water. Present invention includes also a front inlet room on bow built from draught line on top, hulls on both sides and to bottom of vessel for collection of front water on vessel bow. Such front water coming into front inlet room is directed into at least one water tunnel built and run through whole vessel to a rear discharging room at stem for discharging. So, all front water coming to vessel running through water tunnels becomes momentum for vessel moving forward under power of propellers within water tunnels by engine of vessel. Wave water over draught line on bow would splash on top of protruded front inlet room and wash down to outboard of hull on both sides back to water surface. Present invention vessel design brings oncoming water diverted to outboard, into water tunnel or over roof top, either no affects to vessel or become momentum for vessel moving with minimum pressure wave.',\n",

After Tallow fatty acids and Palm oil fatty acids, fatty acids from sustainable sources like Rice bran fatty acids (RBFA) are desired. RBFA is formed as a by-product during refining of Rice bran oil and hence it is contained in the non edible portion of the oil. The production of high quality esterquats from this by-product is challenging, but the invention describes a process to produce high quality esterquats having low odour and a low acid value. This enhances easy formulation of various products and better customer acceptance. Liquid esterquats produced from RBFA enable e.g. cold processing for fabric softener formulations.',\n",

In usual practice, pre-charge air pressure checks are done by emptying the system of fluid and connecting an analog air gauge to the air input of the expansion tank. In this invention a pressure sensor that is permanently coupled to the fluid volume of the expansion tank is used to also evaluate the pre-charge air pressure in the tank. By employing a single sensor for both fluid and pre-charge air pressure evaluation, the problem of inconsistent calibration between fluid sensing and air pre-charge measuring devices is eliminated. Using the same permanently installed sensor for every test or adjustment in a given system eliminates the problem of variations in calibration between different sensors or gauges used at different testing times.',\n",

For that purpose, source data is obtained from a plurality of stream sources. The source data is constituted by content data and/or metadata of concurrent portions of the plurality of media streams. By applying a quality assessment function to the source data, a quality score is assigned to each one of the concurrent portions. This allows selection data to be generated which enables the streaming client to access a selected one of the concurrent portions of a respective media stream. For example, a segment may be selected which provides a highest quality score. By doing so, it is therefore not required anymore for a consumer to manually switch between different media streams.',\n",

Minimizing the number of person identifiers that are tracked is beneficial for framing purposes. Typically, a stream of frames is sent to a far side, such as another endpoint device, for viewing. If the number of persons identified keeps changing, the composition of the stream of frames will be constantly changing as well. By using person identification and the use of timers, movement by the same person or a temporary change in a number or set of persons may be detected without making changes to the number of identifiers and persons being framed. It is only when a change has persisted past a period of time that changes are made to the frames, thereby improving the overall viewing experience.',\n",

The scheduler can then analyze each active set to determine whether the active set is a good or bad based on the level of interference in and the number of MIMO receive dimensions available in the respective active set. If the scheduler determines that an active set is a bad, the scheduler can determine a set of metrics that each represent a capacity and link quality that would result if the bad active set is combined with another active set. Based on the set of metrics, the scheduler can combine the bad active set with another active set, and repeat this process until no bad active sets remain.',\n",

The angle of the centerline of a camera field-of-view (FoV) and the angle of the camera FoV is determined. Knowing the angle from the centerline of the microphone array of the particular sound and then the angle of the centerline of the camera FoV and angles of the camera FoV allows a determination if the sound is inside the FoV of the camera. If so, the microphones are unmuted. If not, the microphones are muted. As the camera zooms or pans, the changes in camera FoV and centerline angle are computed and used with the sound angle, so that the muting and unmuting occurs automatically as the camera zoom and pan angle change.',\n",

The flexible structures, which are made of a material that is more flexible than the shell, the brim, and the ridges, are positioned in separation gaps between the shell and the brim and ridges. The shell, brim, ridges, and flexible structures are fused together as a single unibody. When the helmet is subjected to an impact on the brim or the ridges, the corresponding flexible structure deforms so that the brim or ridge moves relative to the shell.

Concerning grouting reinforcement for a ramp in an aquifer, a grouting process is divided into four stages according to a pressure change, that is, micro-pressure filling, low-pressure diffusion, medium-pressure reinforcement, and high-pressure fracturing. In the micro-pressure filling, an initial pressure of a grouting orifice is 0, and a low-concentration single-component grout is used to fill an original fissure of the aquifer. In the low-pressure diffusion, a low-concentration bicomponent grout is used for grouting, the original fissure is expanded, and a grouting radius is increased. In the medium-pressure reinforcement, a high-concentration bicomponent grout is used for grouting, thereby reinforcing the aquifer. In the high-pressure fracturing, a high-concentration bicomponent grout is used to reinforce a new fractured fissure of the orifice caused by a high pressure and the original fissure, thereby forming a confining bed.',\n",
